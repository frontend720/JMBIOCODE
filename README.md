Welcome to JMBIOCODE!
This repository showcases my exploration of the fascinating intersection between JavaScript and Biology. Here, you'll find a collection of interactive learning tools, data-driven projects, and creative collaborations I've built during my journey.

My goal is to:

Learn and apply JavaScript coding skills in a biological context.
Develop interactive tools and visualizations to make biological concepts more accessible and engaging.
Contribute to the growing field of computational biology.
Feel free to browse through the projects, play around with the tools, and learn something new!

Current Projects:

Crop Health Monitoring Dashboard: A web dashboard that connects to field sensors and monitors crop health. It tracks parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, nutrient levels, and pest presence. It helps farmers and agronomists manage their crops more effectively.

Protein-Protein Interaction Network: A web tool that visualizes protein-protein interactions using Cytoscape.js. It lets researchers navigate the network, find important nodes, and study potential drug targets for diseases.

Bioprocess Optimization Tool: A web application for bioreactor and fermentation research. It performs calculations and simulations based on the data entered by the researchers. It helps them find the optimal values for process parameters such as temperature, pH, and nutrient levels. This can improve the yield and efficiency of the bioprocesses.

Technologies Used:

JavaScript (NodeJS, ExpressJS, ReactJS and Firebase)
